# Generalized linear model (GLM)

The output of the Tukey test shows the average difference, a confidence interval as well as whether you should reject the null hypothesis for each pair of groups at the given significance level.
In this case, the test suggests we reject the null hypothesis for 3 pairs, with each pair including the "white" category.
This suggests the white group is likely different from the others.

The 95% confidence interval plot reinforces the results visually: only 1 other group's confidence interval overlaps the white group's confidence interval.
