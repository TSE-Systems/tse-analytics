PhenoMaster Module for TSE Analytics

This module provides functionality for working with data from TSE PhenoMaster systems,
which are used for comprehensive metabolic, behavioral, and physiological phenotyping
of laboratory animals. The module supports various PhenoMaster components including:

- Calorimetry (calo): For measuring metabolic parameters like O2 consumption, CO2 production, and RER
- Drinking and Feeding (drinkfeed): For monitoring food and water consumption
- Activity and Motion (actimot): For tracking animal movement and activity
- TrafficAge: For monitoring animal movement patterns

The module includes components for data loading, processing, analysis, and visualization
of PhenoMaster experimental data.
