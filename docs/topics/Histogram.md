# Histogram

Histograms can be generated in TSE Analytics by selecting **Plot type ‘Histogram’** in the Exploration widget.

- The x-axis of a histogram plot represents the range of data values included in the plot. The y-axis indicates the number of datapoints falling into a defined range of values, referred to as ‘bin’.
- Bins are represented by columns in the histogram plot. The column width shows the range of values covered by a bin, while the height of each bin indicates the number of datapoints assigned to a bin.
- The default number of ten bins used in TSE Analytics is fixed and cannot be adjusted. The width of bins is calculated automatically, based on the total range of values displayed in the current plot divided by ten.

> **Note**: Less than ten columns are displayed in the histogram overview if the number of values assigned to a bin is very small or zero.
> Columns for small numbers of values appear when zooming into the respective area of the plot (Zoom in (‘Magnifying glass’) in the plot menu) at the bottom of the control panel.
> No column is displayed if the number of values assigned to a bin is zero.
