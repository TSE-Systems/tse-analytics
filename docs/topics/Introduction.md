# Introduction

TSE Analytics is a data analysis application designed specifically to work with the data output produced by *TSE PhenoMaster* software.
It allows a simplified management of multiple datasets, data sharing and reproducibility of experimental results in a flexible and user-friendly way.

TSE Analytics offers a wide range of tools for easy and convenient processing of large datasets. These include:

- **Integrated Data Handling**: TSE Analytics is designed to manage complex datasets like PhenoMaster data and integrates data processing, visualization, and statistical analysis.
- **Flexible Data Customization**: The software allows users to tailor data structures to their specific needs by, for example, excluding outliers, defining time frames, merging multiple datasets, and creating new grouping factors.
- **Automated Data Management**: TSE Analytics facilitates multi-dataset management with automatic metadata extraction and dataset processing options.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: TSE Analytics allows to quickly visualize data over time using the plot function and quickly screen and compare data across different groups, individual animals, or specific time periods.
- **Comprehensive Statistical Analysis**: The software includes a broad range of statistical tools, from data exploration to advanced analyses.
- **User-Friendly, Flexible and Efficient**: TSE Analytics stands out for its ease of use and extensive analytical capabilities combined with various export functions.
- **Reproducibility and Collaboration**: By using TSE Analytics, researchers can generate standardized output reports to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of research findings.

## Data Visualization and Statistical Analysis

TSE Analytics hosts various options for data analysis and visualization:

- **Timeline Visualization**: Visualize raw data on a timeline or in time bins with the possibility to easily switch between individual animals or apply grouping by factors or runs.
- **Explorative Analysis**: Assess and visualize data distribution of selected variables using histograms, violin or box plots, and normality analysis with the possibility to apply grouping by animal, factor or run.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Calculate correlations between two variables using correlation or linear regression analysis.
- **AN(C)OVA**: Perform several types of ANOVA (N-way, repeated measures, mixed design) or ANCOVA under consideration of factors and time bins.
- **Multivariate and High-Dimensional Analysis**: Visualize and analyze correlations between multiple variables using matrix plots and dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Perform time series analysis to detect patterns or trends in PhenoMaster data collected at regular time intervals.

In this user manual, we will provide a detailed guide on how to operate TSE Analytics, including how to import, process, and analyze PhenoMaster data.
With step-by-step instructions and practical examples, users will be able to quickly get started and make the most of the software's features. Now, letâ€™s begin!
