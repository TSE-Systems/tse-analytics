# Data

The *Data* Widget is a sub-widget within the *Add Widget* section of the TSE Analytics Software. It provides essential tools for visualizing source data, helping users gain a clearer understanding of the data’s characteristics and patterns. The Data Widget primarily consists of two components: **Table** and **Plot**.

When using the Data Widget, users can visualize source data from different dimensions or perspectives by interacting with the interface’s right-side widgets, such as the *Variable* Widget or the *Split Mode* Widget. By selecting or filtering variables as needed, users can customize data visualization to suit specific analysis requirements.

This functionality allows for greater flexibility in exploring and interpreting the data, making it easier to identify trends, outliers, and relationships within the dataset.
