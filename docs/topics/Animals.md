# Animals

Here users can select one or many animals from the list of all animals that were registered in the experiment. This
allows to filter (exclude) some of them from further analysis and visualisation.

The **Animal** widget contains a list of all animals included in the dataset and works as an animal selector for analysis.
Animal names/IDs in the column **“Animal”** can be edited by **double-clicking** on the name/ID of the respective animal and entering a new name/ID.

All animals in an animal list can be selected at once (all boxes checked) by clicking **Check All**.
All animals can be deselected at once (all boxes unchecked) by clicking **Uncheck All**.
Alternatively, press <shortcut>Ctrl+A</shortcut> or drag mouse over entries you want to choose.
To select/deselect individual entries, click on the entry holding <shortcut>Ctrl</shortcut> key.
