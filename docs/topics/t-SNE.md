# t-SNE

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a dimensionality reduction technique specifically designed for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space (typically 2D or 3D).
It is particularly effective for embedding high-dimensional data into a space of two or three dimensions, which can then be visualized in a scatter plot.
