- **Data Widget** 

The _Data Widget_ is designed to display the selected raw dataset, offering two intuitive view modes to suit user needs. The **Table** view presents data in a structured, tabular format, making it easy to reference and interpret specific values. Alternatively, the **Plot** view visualizes data through charts, providing a clear and concise way to identify patterns, trends, and distributions at a glance.

- **Statistical Analysis Widgets** 

The _Statistical Analysis Widgets_ offers a range of tools, each corresponding to a specific statistical method, to cater to diverse data analysis needs. 

**Exploration** provides tools for initial data examination.**Bivariate** focuses on analyzing relationships between two variables using techniques like correlation and regression. **ANOVA** enables comparison of means across multiple groups through analysis of variance. **Dimensionality** includes methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify high-dimensional data. **Time Series** equips users with tools for analyzing temporal data, including Decomposition and autocorrelation. 

Detailed instructions for using each method are provided in subsequent chapters.

- **Utils Widget**

The _Utils_ widget is designed to help users edit and refine reports generated from data analysis. After completing the analysis, clicking **Update** for showing the analysis result, then click **Add to Report** , the report will be copied into the report editor. Users can then navigate to **Add Widget - Utils** to access the editor, where can customize and format their report content to align with their presentation or documentation needs.
