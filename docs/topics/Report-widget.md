# Report widget

In addition to specific export options which vary between different analysis and plots, all results can be saved within a workspace and outside of TSE Analytics using the **Report** function. 

- Result tables and graphs can be added to the Report by clicking **Add to Report** at the bottom of the control panel of the respective widget. 
- In addition, the Report works as a text editor and allows to add customized text to analysis results. 

The Report menu offers several tools for editing the report and text elements (from left to right):

- Undo/Redo 
- Cut/ Copy/ Paste
- Selection of text font
- Selection of text size
- Text style: Bold/ Italic/ Underline
- Content alignment: Left/ Center/ Right/ Justify

Each dataset has an individual report and all reports are saved within a workspace in TSE Analytics when saving the workspace. 

Reports can also be saved outside of TSE Analytics as an .html file by clicking on the **Save** button (‘Memory disk’ symbol) in the Report menu.

Reports can also be printed by clicking on the **Print** button (‘Printer’ symbol) in the Report menu. If **Microsoft Print to PDF** is selected under **Printer** in the printing settings, reports can thereby also be saved as .pdf files.
