# Workspaces

A *Workspace* comprises all datasets (one or multiple) listed in the Dataset tab including copies of imported datasets and merged datasets as well automatically extracted meta-data and settings which have been edited after import.
These include animal information, factors, plot settings, settings for time binning (including light/dark phases and custom time phases), animal selection, exclusion of animals and exclusion of time phases. 

Moreover, the report for each dataset is saved within a workspace and is restored when opening the workspace. 
A *Workspace* can be saved via **File | Save Workspace** or by clicking the **Save Workspace** button.
