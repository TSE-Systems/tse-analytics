# Animal List

The **Animal** widget contains a list of all animals included in the dataset and works as an animal selector for analysis. Animal names/ IDs in the column **“Animal”** can be edited by **double-clicking** on the name/ ID of the respective animal and entering a new name/ ID. 

> **Warning:** An existing animal name/ ID must not be assigned to another animal, since this will result in overwriting existing data.
